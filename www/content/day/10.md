# Day 10: The Stars Align

For [Day 10](https://adventofcode.com/2018/day/10) "stars", with a starting
position and velocity, have to be animated until such a point where they spell
out a message.

The core of this solution is obviously fairly simple:

{{< highlight nim >}}
proc move_sky*(points: var Points) =
  for i, point in points:
      points[i].x = point.x + point.vx
      points[i].y = point.y + point.vy
{{< /highlight>}}

Run that for the correct number of iterations and the "stars" will have
aligned... The actual `move_sky` function used in the solution is slightly
bigger as it also calculates the bounds of the stars, which are used to detect
when the stars have aligned and the message is readable.

The difficult, and unnecessary, bit of this challenge was figuring out how to
render this onto an HTML5 canvas using Nim, given that I had zero experience
with the compiling Nim to JavaScript, the HTML5 canvas, using the canvas from
Nim, or accessing the DOM from nim... but the result can be seen below!
